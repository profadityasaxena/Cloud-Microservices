# A Framework for Digital Transformation Teams to Design Microservices Architecture from a Monolith

## Overview

This research-driven project presents a comprehensive and actionable framework for enterprise digital transformation teams to systematically migrate from monolithic systems to microservices architecture. The work is grounded in an extensive review of 20 peer-reviewed papers, real-world case studies, and reference architecture models.

The goal is to support architectural assessment, service decomposition, migration planning, DevOps tooling, and resilience design using a pedagogically structured, literature-backed methodology.
