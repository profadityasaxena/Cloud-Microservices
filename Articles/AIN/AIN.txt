DOI: 10.1109/ICITR57877.2022.9992918

Objective:
This paper evaluates the impact of different inter-service communication protocols on the performance of microservice-based systems. It focuses on measuring response time and throughput in a cloud environment, aiming to provide guidance on choosing the most efficient communication mechanism
during microservice development or monolith-to-microservice migration.

Background and Motivation:
- Monolithic applications use in-process communication, which is fast and low-latency.
- Microservices shift communication over the network, introducing latency and requiring careful
  protocol selection.
- The challenge lies in selecting the right inter-service communication protocol to balance performance,
  scalability, and maintainability.

Communication Mechanisms Evaluated:
1. REST over HTTP
2. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
3. WebSocket

Implementation Setup:
- Microservices implemented in Java using Spring Boot.
- Two services (A and B) communicate, with response time logged using Log4j2.
- Only inter-service communication latency is measured (excluding application logic).
- Benchmarks were conducted in a cloud-based environment using industry-standard load testing.

Results:
1. gRPC:
   - Delivered the best response times and highest throughput.
   - Uses Protocol Buffers for serialization and reuses TCP connections.
   - Suitable for synchronous internal communication.

2. REST:
   - Easy to use and widely supported.
   - Higher latency than gRPC.
   - Performance degrades under high concurrency.

3. WebSocket:
   - Supports full-duplex asynchronous communication.
   - Outperformed REST under some conditions.
   - Less common for typical inter-service APIs and harder to manage.

Challenges Identified:
- Lack of standardized approach to decompose monoliths into microservices.
- Difficulty in preserving transactional ACID properties in distributed systems.
- Dynamic service discovery is required as services scale in and out.
- Inter-service communication adds significant network latency compared to monolithic intra-process calls.

Conclusion:
- Communication mechanism choice is a critical architectural decision.
- gRPC is recommended for internal microservice communication due to its performance.
- REST remains useful for public APIs due to simplicity and adoption.
- WebSocket can be advantageous for real-time asynchronous use cases but requires careful implementation.

Relevance to Your Framework:
This paper directly supports the Assessment and Migration Strategy phases of your project by:
- Highlighting communication-related performance bottlenecks.
- Demonstrating protocol selection as a critical performance design decision.
- Supporting the recommendation to use gRPC for synchronous, performance-sensitive service-to-service communication.

RQ1. What is the performance impact of different inter-service communication protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC, WebSocket) during microservice migration from monolithic architectures?

RQ2. How can communication latency and throughput metrics inform the selection of protocols for internal microservice communication?

RQ3. What are the architectural trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication styles in microservice-based systems?

RQ4. How does the choice of inter-service communication mechanism influence the scalability and fault-tolerance of microservice architectures?

RQ5. What best practices can be established for integrating high-performance communication protocols like gRPC into the microservice design during the decomposition of monolithic systems?

1. Microservices vs Monolith:
   - Monolithic applications use fast, in-process communication.
   - Microservice systems introduce network-based communication between services, adding performance overhead.

2. Communication Mechanisms Compared:
   - REST (HTTP-based, synchronous, widely used).
   - gRPC (protocol-buffer-based, synchronous, high-performance).
   - WebSocket (asynchronous, bidirectional communication).

3. Methodology:
   - Implemented two microservices using Spring Boot in Java.
   - One service calls another using the evaluated protocol.
   - Measured pure inter-service response time using Log4j2 logs.
   - Benchmarked in a cloud-based environment under simulated load.

4. Key Findings:
   - gRPC outperforms REST and WebSocket in terms of response time and throughput.
   - REST is simple and popular but shows higher latency and limited scalability under high load.
   - WebSocket shows benefits in asynchronous scenarios but is complex to manage for typical API usage.

5. Architectural Implications:
   - No universal standard exists for breaking monoliths into microservices.
   - Inter-service communication significantly impacts performance and must be carefully selected.
   - Protocol choice affects the quality attributes of the system: latency, scalability, and resilience.

6. Recommendations:
   - Use gRPC for internal microservice-to-microservice communication where low latency is critical.
   - Use REST for external-facing services where simplicity and integration with diverse clients is important.
   - Use WebSocket for real-time, event-driven, or streaming scenarios.

7. Challenges Highlighted:
   - Managing service discovery and dynamic scaling in distributed systems.
   - Maintaining transactional integrity (ACID) across distributed services.

Title: Exploring Sustainable Alternatives for the Deployment of Microservices Architectures in the Cloud  
Authors: V. Cortellessa, D. Di Pompeo, M. Tucci  
Conference: 2024 IEEE 21st International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)  
DOI: 10.1109/ICSA59870.2024.00012  
Pages: 34â€“41

Objective:  
This paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing the deployment of microservices architectures in the cloud by balancing three key objectives: performance, deployment cost, and energy consumption. The goal is to guide architects in selecting deployment strategies that are not only effective but also sustainable in the long term.

Background:  
- Microservices architectures are highly suitable for cloud-native applications due to their scalability and modularity.  
- However, energy efficiency is often overlooked in favor of performance and cost, leading to potentially unsustainable deployments.  
- The increasing energy demands of cloud data centers necessitate strategies that explicitly account for power consumption.

Key Contributions:  
1. A multi-objective optimization approach using NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) to explore deployment alternatives.  
2. A modeling framework that combines UML-based software architecture modeling with Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance analysis.  
3. Introduction of a complexity-aware refactoring cost model.  
4. Application of the method to a well-known case study: Train Ticket Booking Service (TTBS).

Methodology:  
- The authors model the microservice architecture using UML with the MARTE profile, capturing structural, behavioral, and deployment aspects.  
- Performance is analyzed via LQN models.  
- Deployment scenarios are evaluated using:  
  a. Response time (performance)  
  b. Power consumption (using CPU utilization and server energy profiles)  
  c. Deployment cost (based on Amazon EC2 pricing)  
  d. Refactoring complexity (cost of applying architectural changes)  
- The optimization process is executed using NSGA-II to generate Pareto-optimal architectural configurations.

Objectives Used in Optimization:  
1. Power Consumption: Estimated using a model by Xu and Jian that incorporates CPU utilization and idle power characteristics.  
2. Response Time: Computed as the aggregated service response time across different request types.  
3. Complexity: Calculated based on a combination of base refactoring cost and architecture-dependent complexity.  
4. Cost: Deployment cost based on instance types selected from Amazon EC2 (t2.micro to d2.2xlarge).

Experiments:  
- Case Study: TTBS (Train Ticket Booking Service), a microservices-based web application.  
- Multiple deployment configurations evaluated through refactoring actions such as:  
  - REDEPLOY  
  - CLONE  
  - MOVE operation/component  
  - DROP node  
- Compared baseline (performance + cost + complexity) vs power-aware (adds energy consumption) optimization objectives.  
- Experiments repeated 31 times to ensure statistical robustness.

Key Findings:  
- Incorporating energy consumption in optimization significantly alters the selected deployment configurations.  
- Performance can be maintained or improved while reducing power consumption, often without a major increase in cost.  
- Refactoring complexity can vary greatly across deployment decisions and must be balanced with sustainability.  
- User behavior (types of requests) influences the optimality of deployment decisions.  
- Merging microservices or consolidating them on fewer nodes can reduce energy and cost but may affect modularity.

Conclusion:  
- Sustainable deployment of microservices requires explicit consideration of energy alongside performance and cost.  
- The proposed NSGA-II-based optimization framework enables design-time exploration of trade-offs.  
- Power-aware deployment decisions can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible software systems.  
- Future work includes broader industrial validation and integration with runtime adaptation strategies.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
This paper is particularly valuable for the Reference Architecture Design and Deployment Planning phases of your framework. It supports:  
- Use of model-driven engineering (UML + MARTE + LQN) for architectural analysis.  
- Inclusion of energy consumption as a first-class concern in microservice deployment.  
- Use of evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) to automate the evaluation of complex trade-offs in deployment strategies.  
- Consideration of deployment instance types (e.g., EC2 cost-performance-energy profiles) as part of infrastructure decisions.  
It also provides a rich set of metrics and modeling assumptions that you can directly apply or cite when defining optimization criteria in your proposed framework.

Title: Combining API Patterns in Microservice Architectures: Performance and Reliability Analysis  
Authors: A. El Malki and U. Zdun  
Conference: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)  
Pages: 246â€“253  
DOI: 10.1109/ICWS60048.2023.00044

Objective:  
This paper investigates the performance and reliability implications of combining different API patterns used for communication between microservices. The aim is to provide architectural guidance on how to mix patterns like REST, event-driven messaging, and gRPC while preserving system performance and fault tolerance.

Background:  
- Microservices rely heavily on well-defined APIs for communication.  
- REST, gRPC, and messaging patterns (e.g., publish/subscribe or message queues) are commonly used.  
- Each API pattern introduces trade-offs in terms of latency, throughput, coupling, and failure handling.  
- There is limited empirical data and systematic guidance on how to combine these patterns in a single architecture.

Methodology:  
- The authors model several communication topologies where different API patterns coexist (e.g., REST-to-gRPC, gRPC-to-Queue, etc.).  
- Simulation experiments are run using a microservice testbed to evaluate performance and fault scenarios.  
- Metrics include response time, throughput, retry success rate, and system behavior under failure.

API Patterns Evaluated:  
1. REST: Synchronous HTTP-based communication; high adoption, higher latency.  
2. gRPC: Synchronous with binary protocol; efficient but tightly coupled.  
3. Messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka): Asynchronous; decouples producers and consumers but adds complexity.

Scenarios Tested:  
- Pure REST architecture  
- Pure gRPC architecture  
- Messaging-based architecture  
- Hybrid patterns (e.g., REST to messaging, gRPC to REST)  
- Injected network faults, timeouts, and message drops to test reliability and fallback behavior

Key Findings:  
1. Pure REST and pure gRPC provide good performance under low to medium load but degrade under failures due to tight coupling.  
2. Messaging-based communication increases reliability and decoupling but may introduce higher end-to-end latency.  
3. Hybrid architectures can balance trade-offs if designed with clear boundaries (e.g., use messaging for critical workflows, REST/gRPC for real-time queries).  
4. Retry and fallback mechanisms significantly impact the systemâ€™s ability to recover under failure.  
5. Combining patterns requires careful attention to protocol mismatches, serialization formats, and monitoring complexity.

Architectural Implications:  
- Use REST or gRPC where strong consistency and low latency are required.  
- Use asynchronous messaging where decoupling and failure resilience are more important.  
- Use circuit breakers and retry policies in synchronous patterns to mitigate downtime.  
- Prefer message-driven architecture for workflows that tolerate eventual consistency.  
- Apply API composition strategies to isolate synchronous and asynchronous zones in system design.

Conclusion:  
- There is no single best API pattern; effective microservice architectures often require a combination.  
- Design decisions must be guided by the systemâ€™s performance, consistency, and availability requirements.  
- The paper contributes a set of tested patterns and design recommendations for building resilient microservice APIs.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Supports the Reference Architecture Design and Migration Strategy phases.  
- Provides empirical support for combining synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (messaging) APIs.  
- Highlights the need for fault-handling mechanisms during and after migration from monolithic systems.  
- Informs tooling and design choices in DevOps environments where observability and failure recovery are crucial.

RQ1. How does the combination of synchronous and asynchronous API patterns affect the performance and fault tolerance of microservice architectures during monolith-to-microservice migration?

RQ2. What are the key trade-offs between REST, gRPC, and messaging patterns when designing communication strategies for decomposed microservices?

RQ3. How can hybrid API architectures be optimized to ensure system resilience, scalability, and maintainability in digitally transformed systems?

RQ4. What role do retry, timeout, and fallback mechanisms play in ensuring reliability during service interaction in heterogeneous API environments?

RQ5. How should digital transformation teams structure communication boundaries to isolate concerns between real-time and eventual-consistency service interactions?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. Different API patternsâ€”REST, gRPC, and messagingâ€”offer distinct performance, coupling, and reliability characteristics.
2. REST is widely adopted and easy to implement but suffers from higher latency and tight coupling.
3. gRPC provides lower latency and better serialization efficiency but also tightens coupling and requires complex versioning.
4. Messaging patterns decouple services and improve fault tolerance but can increase end-to-end latency and operational complexity.
5. Pure architectures (e.g., only REST or only messaging) are rarely optimal; combining patterns can yield better system properties.
6. Hybrid architectures must address protocol translation, serialization mismatches, and interface design carefully.
7. The placement of retry and fallback logic significantly influences the systemâ€™s resilience to faults.
8. The paper provides experimental evidence and design heuristics to guide API strategy decisions during system design and evolution.
9. The choice of API patterns should align with specific service goalsâ€”availability, consistency, and responsiveness.
10. Observability and structured logging are critical when combining API protocols, especially in failure analysis and debugging.

Pages: 20357â€“20376  
Year: 2022  
DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152803

Objective:  
This paper presents a detailed experimental comparison between monolithic and microservice architectures with respect to performance, scalability, resource utilization, and operational complexity. The primary aim is to help practitioners and researchers better understand trade-offs in migrating to microservices.

Background:  
- Many organizations transition from monolithic systems to microservices without quantitative evidence supporting performance or scalability benefits.  
- The architectural decision to adopt microservices entails changes in deployment, testing, communication, and fault management patterns.  
- Prior research often lacks experimental reproducibility or considers limited operational contexts.

Methodology:  
- Developed two versions of the same system: one monolithic and one microservice-based.  
- Deployed both versions in identical environments and subjected them to varying load levels.  
- Metrics collected included: request latency, CPU and memory usage, response time under load, and horizontal scaling behavior.  
- Used Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration of the microservices version.  
- Container-level resource tracking enabled detailed measurement of runtime characteristics.

System Under Test:  
- A realistic application designed as a 3-tier system (presentation, logic, data layers).  
- Monolith: implemented as a single application.  
- Microservices: decomposed into independent services (e.g., auth, catalog, payment, order), each in a separate container.  
- Communication between services handled via REST.

Evaluation Metrics:  
1. Latency per request under varying concurrent loads.  
2. Response time trends as services scale.  
3. CPU and memory utilization across containers.  
4. Error rates and recovery performance under simulated faults.  
5. Deployment complexity and overhead in container orchestration.

Key Results:  
- Microservices showed higher baseline latency due to inter-service network overhead.  
- Under high concurrency, microservices outperformed the monolith in response time and stability due to isolated scaling.  
- Monolith exhibited performance bottlenecks due to shared resources and lock contention.  
- Microservices used more system resources overall but allowed more granular horizontal scaling.  
- Deployment complexity, monitoring overhead, and failure recovery were higher in microservices.

Conclusions:  
- Microservices offer superior scalability and fault isolation under high-load conditions.  
- Monolithic systems can be more efficient in low-load scenarios with simpler operational needs.  
- Migrating to microservices should be driven by specific goals like resilience, scalability, and modular evolutionâ€”not just trend adoption.  
- Performance gains from microservices depend on system design quality, communication efficiency, and orchestration capabilities.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Provides empirical justification for transitioning to microservices in high-demand scenarios.  
- Supports key arguments in your framework's Assessment Phase regarding system load characteristics.  
- Informs architectural decisions on communication, containerization, and orchestration in the Reference Architecture Design phase.  
- Highlights performance trade-offs that transformation teams must evaluate when planning migration from monolith to microservices.

RQ1. What are the quantifiable performance and scalability trade-offs between monolithic and microservice architectures under varying workloads?

RQ2. How does container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) influence the resource efficiency and scalability of microservice-based deployments compared to monolithic systems?

RQ3. In what scenarios does a monolithic architecture outperform a microservice-based architecture in terms of latency and system resource usage?

RQ4. How can transformation teams decide when to migrate from monolithic to microservice architectures based on empirical performance indicators?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. The study provides a head-to-head experimental comparison between monolithic and microservice architectures using identical functional systems.
2. Microservices introduce higher baseline latency due to inter-service communication but scale more effectively under high load.
3. Monolithic systems are more efficient in low-concurrency environments due to the lack of network overhead.
4. Microservices enable better fault isolation and modular scaling by distributing load across independent containers.
5. Resource utilization in microservices is higher because of containerized overhead and service replication.
6. Kubernetes orchestration allows automated scaling and resilience in microservices but adds operational complexity.
7. Monitoring and failure recovery are more complex in microservices due to distributed components and dependency chains.
8. Performance improvements from microservices are workload-dependent; benefits emerge under concurrent, high-throughput conditions.
9. The monolith exhibited resource contention issues, which microservices avoided through isolated deployments.
10. Architectural decisions must be driven by the specific needs of the system, such as modularity, fault tolerance, and expected load patterns.

Journal: IEEE Access  
Volume: 12  
Pages: 35135â€“35155  
Year: 2024  
DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3373316

Objective:  
The paper presents a dynamic microservice scheduling strategy aimed at optimizing cloud application performance. It focuses on minimizing inter-service communication latency and network traffic while enhancing fault tolerance by intelligently distributing microservices across cloud nodes.

Background:  
- Cloud-based microservice systems often suffer from performance issues due to poor placement strategies.
- Traditional schedulers (e.g., round-robin, random) neglect the communication patterns between services, resulting in increased latency and traffic overhead.
- A more informed scheduling mechanism can significantly improve efficiency by reducing service-to-service hops across nodes.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a topology-aware microservice scheduling strategy that:
  a. Minimizes latency by co-locating frequently interacting services.  
  b. Reduces network congestion by optimizing service placement.  
  c. Enhances fault tolerance through redundancy and adaptive service reallocation.  
- Uses a clustering algorithm based on communication frequency and service affinity metrics.

Architecture and Workflow:  
1. Service Graph Construction â€“ Models service dependencies and call frequencies.  
2. Clustering â€“ Groups highly interactive services using graph partitioning.  
3. Scheduling â€“ Assigns clusters to cloud nodes based on available resources and fault tolerance goals.  
4. Monitoring â€“ Continuously evaluates service performance and triggers rescheduling if thresholds are violated.

Key Features:  
- Uses historical and real-time communication data to guide service clustering.  
- Fault-aware deployment ensures service replicas are distributed across failure zones.  
- Incorporates vertical and horizontal autoscaling policies based on load.  
- Integrates with Kubernetes for actual deployment and orchestration.

Evaluation and Experiments:  
- Simulated workload on a testbed consisting of 4 to 8 cloud nodes.  
- Compared against baseline strategies: random, round-robin, and resource-aware schedulers.  
- Metrics measured: average response time, inter-node traffic volume, fault recovery time, throughput.

Results:  
- Reduced average network latency by up to 28% compared to baseline.  
- Lowered inter-node traffic volume by over 35%.  
- Improved system throughput under peak load conditions.  
- Faster recovery from node failures due to intelligent replica distribution.

Conclusion:  
- Topology-aware scheduling significantly boosts performance and fault tolerance in microservice deployments.  
- Proper placement of services based on communication affinity is critical for latency-sensitive applications.  
- The scheduling algorithm can be integrated with existing orchestrators like Kubernetes to enhance runtime decisions.  
- Future work includes applying AI/ML techniques for predictive service placement.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Highly relevant to the DevOps and Deployment Planning phases of your framework.  
- Reinforces the importance of service placement strategies in Reference Architecture Design.  
- Introduces key metrics and modeling practices for evaluating microservice deployment efficiency.  
- Demonstrates that communication-aware scheduling is a critical optimization lever in cloud-native modernization projects.

RQ1. How can communication-aware scheduling improve the performance and fault tolerance of microservice-based cloud applications during digital transformation?

RQ2. What are the measurable benefits of clustering and co-locating interdependent microservices in reducing network traffic and latency?

RQ3. How does topology-aware microservice placement influence recovery time and system resilience in the event of node or zone failures?

RQ4. What role does real-time monitoring and dynamic rescheduling play in maintaining QoS (Quality of Service) for scalable microservice systems?

RQ5. How can microservice orchestration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes) be extended or configured to support intelligent, affinity-based service scheduling?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. Traditional microservice schedulers often ignore service communication patterns, leading to suboptimal performance.
2. The proposed scheduling strategy models microservice dependencies using service interaction graphs.
3. Frequently communicating services are clustered and co-located to reduce inter-node communication latency.
4. The scheduling algorithm optimizes three key objectives: latency, fault tolerance, and network traffic minimization.
5. Historical and real-time communication metrics are used to inform scheduling decisions dynamically.
6. Kubernetes integration allows the algorithm to operate within existing orchestration infrastructures.
7. The system supports automatic rescheduling based on performance threshold violations or failure events.
8. Experimental results show significant improvements in latency (up to 28%) and network traffic reduction (over 35%).
9. The strategy increases fault tolerance by ensuring service replicas are distributed across availability zones.
10. The paper suggests future enhancements using predictive modeling and AI for proactive scheduling.

Objective:  
This paper proposes a topology-aware scheduling framework for optimizing the placement of microservices in cloud data centers. The objective is to minimize service latency and inter-node communication by considering the physical and logical network topology of the cloud infrastructure during microservice scheduling.

Background:  
- Microservice-based cloud applications often incur high communication overhead due to poor service placement across distributed nodes.  
- Traditional schedulers fail to account for network distances and traffic when deploying services, resulting in increased response time and bandwidth usage.  
- Awareness of underlying infrastructure topology can enable more efficient microservice placement.

Proposed Framework:  
- Introduces **TAS-MSA** (Topology-Aware Scheduling for Microservice Applications).  
- TAS-MSA models both the microservice call graph and the data centerâ€™s topology (switches, racks, servers).  
- Scheduling decisions consider the latency and bandwidth between nodes, microservice affinity, and resource availability.

Framework Components:  
1. **Topology Modeler** â€“ Captures network topology and resource distribution (racks, links, nodes).  
2. **Call Graph Analyzer** â€“ Builds a weighted graph of inter-service calls based on frequency and latency.  
3. **Affinity-Based Clustering** â€“ Groups microservices that interact frequently.  
4. **Latency-Cost Estimator** â€“ Estimates latency impact of placing services on different nodes.  
5. **Placement Engine** â€“ Assigns service groups to optimal physical nodes using a heuristic search algorithm.

Methodology:  
- Implements TAS-MSA in a Kubernetes-based environment.  
- Evaluates performance using a set of real-world microservice benchmarks (e.g., TrainTicket, SockShop).  
- Compares TAS-MSA with baseline schedulers: Random, Resource-Aware, and Spread.

Experimental Setup:  
- 3-layer data center topology (core, aggregation, access layers).  
- Metrics: average response time, tail latency (95th percentile), cross-rack communication volume, scheduling time.

Key Results:  
- TAS-MSA reduces average latency by 21.3% compared to resource-aware baseline.  
- Cross-rack traffic reduced by up to 31.7%.  
- Achieves better tail latency and improved network bandwidth utilization.  
- Maintains competitive scheduling speed, suitable for dynamic environments.

Conclusion:  
- Topology-aware scheduling provides significant performance benefits for microservice applications in large-scale cloud data centers.  
- Placement strategies that account for service affinity and network proximity are essential for latency-sensitive applications.  
- TAS-MSA can be integrated into container orchestration systems to support efficient cloud-native deployment.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Directly supports the Reference Architecture Design and DevOps deployment optimization areas.  
- Validates the role of physical infrastructure awareness in enhancing microservice performance.  
- Suggests practical clustering and placement techniques applicable in digital transformation scenarios requiring high throughput and low latency.  
- Provides evidence that intelligent orchestration at the infrastructure level is as crucial as application-layer design in successful microservice modernization.

RQ1. How does incorporating physical and logical network topology into microservice scheduling improve performance in cloud environments?

RQ2. What is the impact of affinity-based clustering and topology-aware placement on inter-service latency and bandwidth consumption?

RQ3. How can topology-aware scheduling frameworks like TAS-MSA be integrated into existing orchestration platforms to enhance deployment efficiency?

RQ4. In what ways does network-aware microservice placement reduce tail latency and improve application responsiveness in distributed cloud infrastructures?

RQ5. How can digital transformation teams leverage service call graph analysis and data center topology modeling to guide scalable and latency-optimized system design?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. TAS-MSA is a topology-aware scheduling framework that improves microservice placement by accounting for physical network layout and inter-service communication.
2. Traditional schedulers ignore network topology, resulting in suboptimal latency and bandwidth usage.
3. The system models both the cloud infrastructure topology and microservice call graphs to drive placement decisions.
4. Services that frequently communicate are clustered and placed close together to minimize cross-rack traffic.
5. TAS-MSA reduces average service response time by 21.3% and cross-rack communication by 31.7%.
6. Tail latency improvements were observed, enhancing system responsiveness under peak loads.
7. The scheduler runs efficiently enough for dynamic workloads and is compatible with Kubernetes.
8. The framework uses heuristics and real-time metrics to maintain scheduling scalability and effectiveness.
9. Benchmarks like TrainTicket and SockShop were used to validate real-world applicability.
10. Infrastructure-aware orchestration enhances system-level performance and is a key consideration for modern cloud-native deployments.

Title: How Do Microservices Evolve? An Empirical Analysis of Changes in Open-Source Microservice Repositories  
Authors: Wesley K. G. AssunÃ§Ã£o, Jacob KrÃ¼ger, SÃ©bastien Mosser, Sofiane Selaoui  
Journal: Journal of Systems and Software  
Volume: 204  
Pages: 111788  
Year: 2023  
DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2023.111788

Objective:  
The paper investigates how microservices evolve over time by conducting a large-scale empirical study on 11 open-source microservice-based systems. The goal is to examine the independence of microservices in practice and identify patterns of co-evolution, dependencies, and challenges in maintaining such systems.

Background:  
- Microservices are intended to be independent and loosely coupled.  
- In practice, achieving this independence is difficult due to technological heterogeneity, API contracts, and shared concerns.  
- Understanding real-world evolution patterns helps inform refactoring decisions, architectural improvements, and tool development.

Methodology:  
- Analyzed 7,319 commits across 11 open-source microservice-based systems.  
- Systems were selected based on clear architecture documentation, substantial history, and multi-service implementations.  
- Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted:
  - Quantitative: labeled atomic changes in commits as service-driven, technical, or miscellaneous.
  - Qualitative: reviewed commit messages, issues, pull requests, and documentation to interpret causes for evolution.

Research Questions:  
RQ1: How do microservice-based systems evolve?  
RQ2: Why do microservices evolve in this way?

Key Findings:  
1. Microservices often exhibit **co-evolution**, contradicting the assumption of full independence.  
2. Four recurring evolution patterns were identified:
   - Independent changes (services updated alone)
   - Tuple evolution (specific services frequently changed together)
   - Global commits (changes affecting most or all services)
   - Technological changes (infrastructure/tool updates)
3. Many service-level changes were entangled with unrelated technological modifications or refactorings.  
4. Co-evolution is often caused by architectural flaws (e.g., tight coupling), shared infrastructure, or poor separation of concerns.  
5. Manual analysis revealed that dependencies between services are frequently undocumented and implicit.

Implications:  
- The assumed independence of microservices is not always achieved in practice.  
- Systems may require architectural refactoring to improve modularity and reduce co-change risks.  
- Evolution data (e.g., commit histories) can be mined to reveal hidden dependencies and inform redesign efforts.  
- Tooling and developer awareness are essential to manage service evolution safely and efficiently.

Conclusion:  
- Microservice independence is challenged by real-world development practices.  
- Co-evolution patterns should be explicitly analyzed and mitigated during architectural planning and refactoring.  
- Research and tooling should support both the detection of undesirable dependencies and the management of microservice evolution over time.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Supports the Assessment Phase by emphasizing the need to analyze historical evolution and dependency patterns before decomposition.  
- Highlights risks of hidden service coupling, informing the Reference Architecture Design phase.  
- Provides evidence for incorporating commit history and evolution analysis into migration planning tools.  
- Reinforces the importance of continuous architectural reviews and evolution-aware DevOps practices in microservices adoption.

RQ1. How can commit history and co-evolution patterns be used to assess service independence before migrating from a monolith to microservices?

RQ2. What architectural indicators suggest the presence of hidden dependencies between microservices during system evolution?

RQ3. How can digital transformation teams detect and mitigate risks of service co-evolution during or after decomposition?

RQ4. What tools or techniques can support evolution-aware microservice design and facilitate safer, modular refactoring?

RQ5. To what extent does implicit coupling in microservice systems undermine scalability, maintainability, and deployment autonomy?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. The study analyzed 7,319 commits across 11 open-source microservice systems to understand how microservices evolve over time.
2. Microservices are not always evolved independently; co-evolution among services is common and often undocumented.
3. Four evolution patterns were identified: independent evolution, tuple co-evolution, global commits, and technological changes.
4. Co-evolution is frequently caused by architectural flaws, shared configurations, or cross-cutting concerns.
5. Implicit dependencies are prevalent and rarely captured in documentation, increasing maintenance complexity.
6. Many commits affecting multiple services were not related to business logic but infrastructure or systemic changes.
7. Co-change patterns highlight a need for improved modularity and separation of concerns in microservice design.
8. Developers should monitor service evolution to detect architectural drift or coupling regressions.
9. Commit history and issue logs can reveal useful insights for architectural refactoring and technical debt management.
10. The findings advocate for tooling and processes that support evolution-aware microservice development and maintenance.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2023.111754

Objective:  
This paper proposes an automated method for recovering the architecture of existing microservice-based systems by analyzing both intra-service and inter-service features. The goal is to improve system comprehension, facilitate refactoring, and assist in documentation and modernization efforts.

Background:  
- As microservice systems grow, understanding their evolving architecture becomes increasingly complex.  
- Manual documentation is often incomplete or outdated, complicating tasks such as maintenance, refactoring, and migration.  
- Existing recovery methods typically focus only on service dependencies or internal code structure, but not both.

Proposed Approach:  
- Introduces a recovery method that combines intra-service features (e.g., internal structure, code similarity) with inter-service features (e.g., API calls, data flow).  
- Constructs a hybrid similarity model using both static code analysis and runtime trace data.  
- Applies clustering techniques to organize service components into logical modules and detect inconsistencies or anomalies.

Architecture Recovery Pipeline:  
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Gathers static code attributes and dynamic call traces.  
2. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Derives intra-service features (module structure, call graphs) and inter-service links (API usage, service calls).  
3. **Feature Integration** â€“ Combines both views into a unified similarity matrix.  
4. **Clustering** â€“ Uses agglomerative clustering to group related components and services.  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Assesses the coherence of recovered architecture against known baselines or expert feedback.

Experimental Setup:  
- Evaluated on five real-world open-source microservice systems.  
- Compared performance against baseline tools that rely only on static or dynamic information.  
- Used standard clustering evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and architectural similarity index.

Key Results:  
- The combined approach significantly outperformed single-feature models in identifying architectural boundaries.  
- Achieved higher F1-scores and better alignment with documented architectures.  
- Detected undocumented service interactions and structural anomalies.  
- Demonstrated usefulness for automated documentation, refactoring, and dependency validation.

Conclusion:  
- Combining intra- and inter-service features provides a more accurate and complete view of microservice system architecture.  
- Useful for teams managing legacy microservices, undocumented systems, or preparing for refactoring and modernization.  
- Architecture recovery tools can support continuous architectural conformance in DevOps pipelines.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Directly informs the Assessment Phase of your framework, especially in mapping and understanding existing service boundaries.  
- Provides a technique to validate or generate architectural views when formal documentation is missing.  
- Supports automated detection of dependencies, aiding in service decoupling strategies during migration.  
- Aligns with DevOps and documentation tools aimed at improving architecture visibility and governance in microservice systems.

Volume: 213  
Pages: 112041  
Year: 2024  
DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2024.112041

Objective:  
This paper presents a comprehensive modeling approach for representing and analyzing microservice architectures. The goal is to facilitate system understanding, documentation, and analysis by capturing architectural elements, behaviors, and dependencies using formal models.

Background:  
- Microservices introduce decentralized, loosely coupled architectures that are difficult to model and reason about due to dynamic behavior, asynchronous communication, and deployment variability.  
- Traditional architecture description languages (ADLs) are not well-suited for capturing these characteristics.  
- There is a lack of standardized models and tooling that reflect microservice-specific concerns.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduces a metamodel called **MSAML** (MicroService Architecture Modeling Language) to represent microservice architectures.  
- MSAML supports modeling of service definitions, communication patterns (synchronous/asynchronous), deployment topology, and dependencies.  
- Integrates with UML and provides visual modeling capabilities for software architects.

Key Components of MSAML:  
1. **Service Model** â€“ Captures individual services, APIs, operations, and configurations.  
2. **Interaction Model** â€“ Models communication protocols, message flows, and dependencies.  
3. **Deployment Model** â€“ Describes containerization, node topology, and infrastructure mappings.  
4. **Behavioral Extensions** â€“ Support for specifying workflows, state transitions, and service behavior under fault conditions.

Methodology:  
- Developed a prototype modeling tool using Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).  
- Validated the language through multiple case studies including academic and industry scenarios.  
- Compared expressiveness and usability of MSAML against existing modeling techniques (e.g., UML, ArchiMate).

Case Study Highlights:  
- Case studies demonstrated the ability to capture runtime communication, failures, and resilience strategies.  
- MSAML improved clarity and maintainability of system architecture documentation.  
- Supported simulation and analysis of architectural decisions (e.g., coupling, fault tolerance, scaling).

Conclusion:  
- Formal modeling of microservice systems is both feasible and beneficial for architectural planning, documentation, and validation.  
- MSAML provides a domain-specific modeling approach tailored to microservice needs.  
- Tooling support and integration with DevOps pipelines can enhance architectural visibility and decision-making.  
- Future work includes performance modeling, validation tooling, and broader industrial adoption.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Supports the Reference Architecture Design phase with structured modeling of services, interactions, and infrastructure.  
- Useful for documenting current systems during Assessment and guiding future designs.  
- Enables visualization, simulation, and validation of architectural decisions in migration scenarios.  
- Suggests integrating domain-specific modeling into modernization toolkits to improve governance and maintainability.

Journal: Journal of Systems and Software  
Volume: 191  
Pages: 111361  
Year: 2022  
DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2022.111361

Objective:  
This paper proposes an approach for detecting "microservice smells"â€”design issues and anti-patterns in microservice-based systemsâ€”by combining structural and evolutionary analysis. The goal is to improve the maintainability and quality of microservice architectures by identifying early signs of degradation.

Background:  
- Microservice systems, while modular, are prone to design problems over time due to distributed development, rapid changes, and lack of centralized control.  
- "Smells" are indicators of potential design flaws, such as overly large services, cyclic dependencies, or shared databases.  
- Existing smell detection tools often focus only on structural aspects, ignoring the evolution history of the system.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors define a catalog of microservice-specific smells based on prior research and expert validation.  
- They design a tool-supported approach combining static code analysis with version history mining to detect these smells.  
- Structural analysis includes code metrics (e.g., size, coupling, cohesion) and dependency graphs.  
- Evolutionary analysis includes change frequency, code churn, and co-change patterns over time.

Detection Pipeline:  
1. **Code and Commit Extraction** â€“ Parse static code and extract commit history from repositories.  
2. **Metrics Calculation** â€“ Compute service-level metrics (LOC, complexity, coupling, etc.).  
3. **Smell Identification** â€“ Apply smell definitions to detect issues such as:
   - God Service  
   - Cyclic Dependency  
   - Shared Persistence  
   - Ambiguous Interface  
   - Dense Communication  
4. **Evolutionary Validation** â€“ Check if smells are persistent or recent using commit analysis.

Evaluation:  
- Applied to four real-world microservice systems with Git history.  
- Benchmarked against known issues and developer feedback.  
- Precision and recall calculated for various smell types.

Key Results:  
- The approach successfully detected smells missed by traditional static analysis alone.  
- Evolution data helped differentiate between transient vs. long-standing design issues.  
- Developers confirmed the relevance and usefulness of smell reports.  
- Combining structural and historical data improved overall detection accuracy.

Conclusion:  
- Microservice smells can serve as early warnings for architecture decay.  
- Structural and evolutionary analysis are complementary and enhance detection effectiveness.  
- Tool support enables proactive maintenance and refactoring efforts.  
- Future work includes automating refactoring suggestions and expanding the smell catalog.

Relevance to Your Framework:  
- Directly supports the Assessment Phase by introducing smell detection as a pre-migration diagnostic tool.  
- Informs architectural refactoring decisions during the Migration Strategy phase.  
- Encourages integration of code history and quality metrics into evaluation workflows.  
- Highlights the importance of continuous architecture health monitoring in long-lived microservice systems.

RQ1. How can structural and evolutionary analysis improve the detection of architectural smells in microservice-based systems?

RQ2. What are the most critical microservice-specific design smells that affect system maintainability and evolution?

RQ3. How can version history and code change patterns help distinguish between transient and persistent architectural issues?

RQ4. What role can automated smell detection play in the assessment and refactoring phases of monolith-to-microservice migration?

RQ5. How can smell detection tools be integrated into DevOps workflows to support continuous architectural health monitoring?

Important Points from the Paper:
1. The paper defines a set of microservice-specific design smells such as God Service, Shared Persistence, and Cyclic Dependency.
2. It proposes a hybrid detection approach that combines static code metrics with historical commit analysis.
3. Evolutionary analysis captures long-term design degradation patterns missed by structural inspection alone.
4. The detection pipeline includes parsing repositories, calculating metrics, and validating smells using version history.
5. The approach was validated on four open-source microservice systems with encouraging precision and recall.
6. Evolutionary data helps prioritize smells that are persistent and potentially harmful to architecture.
7. Developers found the tool-generated smell reports relevant for identifying refactoring needs.
8. The tool supports early diagnosis of architectural drift and decay in microservice systems.
9. Automated smell detection contributes to architecture governance and quality assurance.
10. The paper calls for further research into refactoring automation and smell-aware tooling for continuous integration environments.

Objective:  
This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) on resilience in microservice architectures. It categorizes existing approaches, identifies open research challenges, and provides a roadmap for enhancing fault tolerance, recovery, and adaptability in microservice systems.

Background:  
- Microservices introduce distributed system complexities, increasing the risk of partial failures, cascading faults, and runtime uncertainty.  
- Resilience is a core quality attribute that ensures microservices can continue operating under failure conditions.  
- Despite the importance of resilience, there is no unified view of resilience techniques, metrics, and challenges in microservice contexts.

Methodology:  
- Followed Kitchenham's SLR protocol to collect and analyze 108 studies from 2013 to 2021.  
- Focused on resilience mechanisms, failure types, metrics, recovery techniques, and architectural patterns.
